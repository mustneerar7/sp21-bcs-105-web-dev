# Assignment 1 - The CV
As a part of my first ever serious attempt to write a website, heres a simple cv website created with pure HTML and CSS with slick animations and effects.

## Effects
The website is full of subtle effects and animations that make it look more professional and modern. The effects are:

### 1. Onboarding Animation

### 3. Navbar Scroll

And many more... there are subtle effects everywhere. without overdoing them which makes the website look more professional and modern.

### Responsive elements
most of the elements are responsive and will adapt to the screen size.

## How to run
1. Clone the repo.
2. Open in Visual Studio Code.
3. Install the Live Server extension.
4. Right click on the index.html file and click on "Open with Live Server".



**Thats all folks. Cheers!**
